SystemVerilog Functional Coverage for RISC-V ISA

This is a work in progress (Nov. 2022) to develop SystemVerilog Functional Coverage for the RISC-V ISA. The resultant source files are generated from a configurable machine readable definition of the RISC-V ISA.

The resultant source connects to the RVVI-TRACE technology making it easy to adopt and use.

This work is driven by Imperas with requirements from the OpenHW Group [ARVM-FunctionalCoverage project](https://github.com/openhwgroup/programs/blob/master/TGs/verification-task-group/projects/ARVM-FunctionalCoverage/meetings/2022/monthly-report-2022-Oct-17.md).

More information will be provided as the project evolves.
